# bbcode2bash
## WTF does that mean?
Well, this tool is meant to make it easy to turn bbcode color coded text into 256 color escape character colored text that can be rendered by bash. I made this to turn ascii art into something I can use with my terminal windows for bash login messages.

My prefered site to make an image into an ascii art is https://my.asciiart.club/. This is because they support transparency and allow export into bbcode. This script lets bbcode ascii art usable in terminal environments.
